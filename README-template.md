## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was very useful practice to work at meeting specific requirements through a style guide and having an image to replicate. This encouraged me to be precise and deliberate when styling the page.

### Continued development

I need more confidence in structuring the elements within the page in more complex scenarios. Also unsure if the way i sized the image and card could have been done in a more efficient way.
